# **React Blog Application Assignment with Styled-Components**

## **Introduction**

This project is designed to solidify your React skills through the creation of a blog application, with a specific focus on applying **`styled-components`** for styling. This approach combines the power of JavaScript and CSS, promoting a styled, component-based architecture. By integrating routing with **`react-router-dom`** and managing styles with **`styled-components`**, you'll gain hands-on experience in building modern web applications.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone this repository** to begin working on the assignment.
2. **Install necessary dependencies** by running **`npm install`** in the project directory.
3. **Start the development server** with **`npm start`**. Your application will be available at **`http://localhost:3000`**.

## **Objectives**

Your mission is to develop a blog application that not only utilizes React's core features but also showcases your ability to create an appealing user interface with **`styled-components`**. Specifically, you will:

### **Implement Styled-Components for Styling**

- Use **`styled-components`** for all component styles within your application. Aim to create reusable styled components that can be applied across different parts of your app for a cohesive look and feel.

### **Feature 1: Blog Post List**

- Design a homepage that lists all blog posts. Style each post preview with **`styled-components`** to include the post image, post title and summary. Aim for a layout that enhances readability and user engagement.

### **Feature 2: Blog Post Details**

- Enable navigation to a detailed post view when a user clicks on a blog post summary. Style the detailed view with **`styled-components`**, ensuring the post's title, content, and author are prominently displayed.

### **Feature 3: Dynamic User Greeting**

- Create a greeting component that displays messages like "Good morning," "Good afternoon," or "Good evening," based on the current time. Style this component with **`styled-components`** to make the greeting visually appealing and dynamically responsive to the time of day.

### **Feature 4: Navigation and Routing (Using `react-router-dom`)**

- Use **`react-router-dom`** to add routing to your application. Implement routes for the home page, individual blog posts, and an "About" page.
- Ensure the blog post details page uses dynamic routing to display content based on the post clicked.

## **Setup and Requirements**

### **Install Dependencies**

Ensure **`react-router-dom`** and **`styled-components`** are included in your project by running:

```bash

npm install react-router-dom styled-components

```

### **Styling Guidelines**

- Consistency is key. Define a theme (colors, fonts, margins) and stick to it throughout your application.
- Leverage the power of **`styled-components`** for dynamic styling. Use props to adjust styles based on state or user actions.
- Embrace component-based styling. Aim to create small, reusable styled components rather than large, monolithic stylesheets.

## **Submission Guidelines**

Complete the blog application adhering to the objectives outlined above. Your submission will be evaluated based on functionality, adherence to the assignment specifications, and the creativity and consistency of your styling with **`styled-components`**.

To submit your project, use the following Git commands to push your code to the GitHub repository provided by your instructor:

1. **Add your project files to the staging area**:

   To include all your changes in the next commit, use the following command:

   ```bash

   git add .
   ```

   This command adds all modified and new files to the staging area. If you want to add specific files only, replace **`.`** with the file names.

2. **Commit your changes**:

   Once your changes are staged, you need to commit them with a message describing what you've done. Use the following command:

   ```bash

   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

   ```

   Replace **`Your descriptive commit message`** with a brief explanation of your changes. For example, "Implemented styled-components for post list".

3. **Push your changes to GitHub**:

   After committing your changes, push them to the remote repository on GitHub with the following command:

   ```bash

   git push origin main

   ```

   If your branch is named differently (e.g., **`master`** instead of **`main`**), replace **`main`** with the name of your branch.

Ensure you push your changes before the deadline to submit your assignment. If you encounter any issues with Git or GitHub, consult the documentation or seek assistance from your instructor.
